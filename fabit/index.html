			</div>
			
			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“A Man could make tools which would tell him these things, but he still would not know measurement as you know it. What he would know of it, though, is a thing that you cannot know.”</span>

				<span class="big">“What is that?”</span>
			</div>

			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“That it is cold”</span>
			</div>

			<div class="frost">
				<span class="big">“Cold is a relative term.”</span>
			</div>

			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“Yes Relative to Man.”<span>
			</div>

			<div class="frost">
				<span class="big">“But if I were aware of the point on a temperature scale below which an object is cold to a Man and above which it is not, then I, too, would know cold.”</span>

			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“No, you would possess another measurement. ‘Cold’ is a sensation predicated upon human physiology.”</span>

				<span class="big">“I told you that Man possessed a basically incomprehensible nature. His perceptions were organic; yours are not. As a result of his perceptions he had feelings and emotions.”</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“These often gave rise to other feelings and emotions, which in turn caused others, until the state of his awareness was far removed from the objects which originally stimulated it. These paths of awareness cannot be known by that which is not-Man.”</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“Man did not feel inches or meters, pounds or gallons. He felt hear, He felt cold; He felt heaviness and lightness. He knew hatred and love, pride and despair.”</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“You cannot measure these things. You cannot know them. You can only know the things that he did not need to know: dimensions, weights, temperatures, gravities. There is no formula for a feeling. There is no conversion factor for an emotion.”</span>
			</div>
			<div class="frost">
				<span class="big">“There must be, if a thing exists, it is knowable.”</span>

			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“You are speaking again of measurement. I am talking about a quality of experience.”</span>
			</div>
			<div class="mordel">
				<span class="big">“A machine is a Man turned inside-out, because it can describe all the details of a process, which a Man cannot, but it cannot experience that process itself as a Man can.”</span>
